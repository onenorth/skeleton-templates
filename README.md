### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```shell
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install               # Install dependencies
```

### Building Assets

Running ``gulp`` by itself will build all JavaScript and Sass and show a lint report:

```shell
$ gulp
```

Running ``gulp watch`` will watch for Sass changes in the assets directory and build when files are modified.

### Running the Server

```shell
$ node app
```

then fire up a webpage and navigate to: http://localhost:5000
